    You can now start using #{Cache.get(:app_name)}! Start typing ""#{Cache.get(:url)}" - usually just the first three characters is enough, hit tab, and you should see something that looks like
    %img{ src: image_path('searchbox.png'), height: '20px' }
  .search-inner
    %form{ action: '/search', method: 'get' }
      %input{type: 'text', name: 'q', placeholder: 'what do you want to search for? (see commands below)'}
